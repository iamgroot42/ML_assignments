## Assignment 3

### Running code
* Copy 'model_linear.model', 'multi.model' and 'rbf.model' (from the ZIP uploaded on Google Drive) into the 'Models' folder.
* Run `python svm.py` to load the trained models and test them on data-sets. This Will show test-accuracy and plot ROC curves for each of part (a),(b) and (c).
* To train the models, uncomment line 126 in svm.py and run.


### Note
* Models were saved using sklearn, not libSVM.
* Models uploaded to Google Drive, link : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6KHP-N8Mfc6dnVxM2szZ2hFaFE
