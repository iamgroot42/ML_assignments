## Assignment 4

### Running code
* Setup keras (with tensorflow backend) on your machine.
* Run `python nn.py` to train a 2-layer NN for part(3) and an auto-encoder for part(4).
* Models based on 2 optimizers (and 2 different hyper-parameters) are stored in the Models/ directory.
* Run `tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/ffnn` to visualize accuracies/loss for the ffnn.
* Run `tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/autoencoder` to visualize accuracies/loss for the autoencoder.
* Navigate to http://localhost:6006 to view the above metrics/visualize graph via TensorBoard.
